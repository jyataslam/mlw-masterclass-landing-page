                    <p class="qa-container-text">The companies that survived the last six recessions did so because they
                        had a biz dev plan — and — they didn’t wing it. We'll share strategies, ideas, and answer all of
                        your questions around how to best create and implement a planning process that will put you and
                        your sales pipeline in the right position to come roaring out of this recession.</p>

                    <p class="qa-container-text">This is the time for you to double down on pipeline building strategies
                        you may have heard of before but haven't put into place — like sell by chat, sell by webinar,
                        email aikido, podcasts, video series, the powerful ps, LinkedIn events, transitioning from 1:1
                        sales to 1 to many, value ladder and ascension, and the list goes on. We will share key insights
                        on how to implement these into your sales pipeline.</p>

                    <p class="qa-container-text">The data is clear — the companies that came roaring out of the last six
                        recessions were the ones who balanced efficiency-based decisions with investments in R&D,
                        marketing, and other leaps forward in their business, which filled their sales pipeline. There
                        is a recipe for success that can be applied to your sales pipeline, too — then you’ll lead the
                        pack and coming roaring out of this recession.</p>

                    <p class="qa-container-text">Three are three essentials to planting your flag of authority: 1) go
                        narrow to monetize (think niching down), 2) defining your point-of-view (your truth!) and 3) you
                        can't be a one-trick pony (your content must be findable across many channels). And when you get
                        this right — and you apply the pipeline strategies we talk through during this Q&A — your
                        pipeline ignites because you're THE AUTHORITY.</p>

                <h2>Will I be able to ask questions during the session?</h2>
                <p>Yes – absolutely! Stephen and Erik will start off the session sharing one of the latest insights from
                    our research for about 5-10 minutes...and then the rest of the session will be an open mic Q&A
                    format.</p>
                <h2>Will there be a recorded replay of the session?</h2>
                <p>We will record the session but the link will not be publicly posted. If something happens — and you
                    can't attend — just email us and we will send you a private link.</p>
                <h2>Will this be the only Q&A session Stephen and Erik will be offering?</h2>
                <p>Great question — no, they are going to hold open mic sessions every Wednesday at 12:00 CST going
                    forward. But — they are private sessions so you need to register each week so we can be sure to send
                    you the correct link.</p>
